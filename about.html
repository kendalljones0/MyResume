                        <p>I worked at Crumbl for three years during high school. It taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork, customer service, and time management. I learned the importance of maintaining a positive attitude and clear communication in a fast-paced environment, ensuring that each customer had a delightful experience. The role honed my multitasking abilities as I balanced school responsibilities with work commitments, developing a strong work ethic. Additionally, I gained insight into the operations of a successful business. This experience not only built my professional skills but also instilled a sense of responsibility and independence, shaping my personal and career aspirations.</p>
                        <p>I also babysat for families during middle and high school. I learned crucial life skills and fostered a sense of responsibility and empathy. I learned how to effectively manage time and prioritize tasks, ensuring the children's safety while keeping them entertained and engaged. This role developed my problem-solving abilities, as I often had to think on my feet to handle unexpected situations. Communication became key, both in understanding the needs of the children and maintaining clear, honest interactions with their parents. Babysitting also enhanced my patience and adaptability, as I navigated the challenges of caring for children of different ages and temperaments. Ultimately, this experience not only strengthened my leadership skills but also deepened my understanding of nurturing and caregiving.</p>
                        <p>Being a peer mentor at BYU, even for just a few months, has been a transformative learning experience. I am developing a deeper understanding of leadership and the power of active listening as I learn to support my peers through their academic and personal challenges. This role has taught me the importance of empathy and patience, as I help students navigate their unique paths and encourage their growth. I am also learning valuable problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills. Additionally, this experience is enhancing my ability to provide constructive feedback and foster a supportive community. Overall, being a peer mentor is teaching me the significance of building meaningful connections and the impact of guidance and encouragement in others' lives.</p>
